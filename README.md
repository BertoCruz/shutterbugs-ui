## [Deployed Site](https://shutterbugs.vercel.app/)
## Abstract
Are you just starting off as a photographer, or researching different styles of photography? Magnum Photos is a great place to start learning about techniques in shooting photography and storytelling. However, there are many more photographers out there as well. `Shutterbugs` is a site where you can track your photographer teachers and their styling techniques. Here you can journal your notes upon a photographer entry, as well as link some of your favorite photography pieces.

## Possible Future Extensions
- As a user, I should be taken to a details page when I click on a photographer card. Here I should be able to edit my own journal entries as well as the pictures I submitted
- As a user I should also see a section where I can type out field notes and add my own pictures similar to the photographers - this will include creating a new db for storing userâ€™s photography
Incorporate PostgreSQL and Knex JS, as well as deploy this new backend
A resource page filled with helpful tutorials, a user would be able to submit their own resources as well.
